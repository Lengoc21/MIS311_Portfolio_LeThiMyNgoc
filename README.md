**1. Data Overview**

The **“Student Performance”** dataset contains information about students’ demographics and academic results in Math, Reading, and Writing. After cleaning, it includes **199 rows and 8 columns**. The data aims to analyze how parental education and demographic factors affect students’ academic performance.

I used a Pivot Table to identify the most frequent value, which is **"associate's degree"**, and filled the missing values accordingly.

After cleaning, the dataset contains **199 rows and 8 columns**.
All missing and duplicate values were successfully handled, resulting in a clean, consistent, and ready-to-analyze dataset.

**3. Descriptive Analytics**
 
  **- Key Insight 1: Average Student Performance by Parental Level of Education**

   <img width="748" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/216c7a21-6412-4e3c-a833-0096ccbcad7a" />

   The chart shows that students whose parents hold **higher academic degrees**, such as a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree, achieve higher average scores (around 72) compared to those whose parents only completed high school (around 60). This clearly indicates that parental education level has a strong positive influence on students’ academic performance, as more educated parents are likely to provide better academic support, learning resources, and motivation for their children.

   

**-Key Insight 2: Average Student Performance by Race/Ethnicity**

<img width="682" height="326" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb490ea-3b63-400f-8323-fdf904db070a" />


The chart illustrates a clear relationship between students’ academic performance and their racial or ethnic backgrounds.
Students from **Group E have the highest average score** (around 74), while those from **Group A show the lowest performance** (around 64).
This suggests that race and ethnicity may influence learning outcomes, possibly due to differences in socioeconomic conditions, access to educational resources, or cultural learning support among groups.

**Summary:** 
Key insights are valuable for teachers, school administrators, and policymakers, as it highlights the strong link between parental education and student achievement. Understanding this relationship helps schools design appropriate learning support programs that promote equal opportunities and academic growth for all students, regardless of their parents’ education level.
