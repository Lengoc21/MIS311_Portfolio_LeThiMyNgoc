**1. Data Overview**

The dataset used in this analysis is named **“06_Students_Performance”** and contains **200 rows** and **8 columns**. It provides information about students’ academic performance, including demographic factors such as **gender, race/ethnicity, and parental level of education, along with their math, reading, and writing scores**. Two additional columns: total_score and average_score , represent each student’s overall academic performance.

**2. Data Cleaning**

Using PivotTable, I observed that **“associate’s degree”** had the highest frequency among all education levels.

**3.Descriptive Analytics**
 
  **- Key Insight 1**: The chart shows how the total student performance varies according to the parents’ education level.
Students whose parents have an associate’s degree or some college education achieved the highest total scores **(around 3350 and 3317)**, suggesting that higher parental education may lead to better academic support and performance.

**-Key Insight 2**: The chart illustrates the relationship between **parental education level and students’ total subject scores**, **filtered by race/ethnicity**.  Students whose parents completed some college or an associate’s degree tend to achieve **the highest total scores across math, reading, and writing**.  This suggests that higher parental education is positively linked to better student performance, regardless of ethnic background.

**Summary:** 
In this analysis, I used **Pivot Tables and Slicers** to summarise and visualise the data effectively. The Pivot Table helped identify trends and compare total scores across different education levels, while the Slicer allowed for dynamic filtering by race/ethnicity. These techniques provided **a clear and interactive overview of the relationships within the dataset.**
